# Original slither.io game rules
As the worm consumes food from the ground, it grows in length and size
When the food bumps into another snake, it is converted into FOOD

# Game rules added in Web3.ver
Tokenize existing food (food = snake body = token).
You grow your snakes by killing your opponent's snakes or 
collecting food from the floor.
If you end the game with a snake alive, you get a token equal to the food you collected.
These tokens can be freely withdrawn

# Detailed rules
10 tokens per inch of snake body.
Players can start the game with a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 100 snakes
Killed snakes yield 0.8x the food of live snakes
Of the remaining 20% of food, 75% becomes food that is scattered 
uniformly on the floor, and the remaining 25% becomes the protocol's revenue.
